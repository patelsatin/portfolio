# Router Basename Fix

## Problem Solved
Fixed the error: `<Router basename="/."> is not able to match the URL "/portfolio" because it does not start with the basename, so the <Router> won't render anything.`

## Root Cause
The `BrowserRouter` in `src/index.js` was using `basename={process.env.PUBLIC_URL}` which was set to `"/."` due to the `homepage: "."` configuration in `package.json`. This caused routing conflicts.

## Solution
Removed the `basename` prop from `BrowserRouter` since it's not needed for Firebase hosting.

### Before (Broken):
```javascript
<BrowserRouter basename={process.env.PUBLIC_URL}>
  <App />
</BrowserRouter>
```

### After (Fixed):
```javascript
<BrowserRouter>
  <App />
</BrowserRouter>
```

## Why This Works
- Firebase hosting serves the app from the root domain
- No subdirectory routing is needed
- React Router works correctly without basename
- All routes (`/portfolio`, `/test-routing`, etc.) are accessible

## Testing
✅ `/portfolio?userid=test123` - Works
✅ `/test-routing` - Works  
✅ `/` (home) - Works
✅ Build process - Successful
✅ No console errors

## Deployment
The fix is now ready for Firebase deployment:
```bash
npm run deploy:firebase
```

All routing issues have been resolved!
